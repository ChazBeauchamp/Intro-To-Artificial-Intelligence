Program Purpose and Assumptions:
-------------------------------
    The purpose of this program is to build a simple reflex agent to model 
    a vacuum cleaner. It implements a behavior tree consisting of a series of 
    composites, tasks, conditions, and decorators. 

    To implement this behavior tree, a couple assumptions were made. First,
    the implementation assumes that children of a priority node are given
    in their proper order (instead of needing to be evaluated by the priority
    node itself). We also assume that once the robot returns home and the 
    "DOCK" task is called, that the vacuum will automatically jump to a battery
    level of 100.

How to Execute Program:
-----------------------

    Terminal Command: py main.py

    Once the program has started you have the option to decide the battery
    level the vacuum initializes with, and the type of cleaning you want to
    perform. The program will terminate when you type "done" at the end of a
    cycle, or after 30 cycles.
